Project to control IKEA hydroponics Krydda/ Växer

#### Planned items:

Control growth with microcontroller/ embedded system and sensors (light, humidity, temperature, CO2, water level etc.)  utilizing automated lighting and water refill with the new IKEA Krydda/ Växer system.

##### Sensors

I added the first sensor to the project. It is a light sensor (BH1750FVI) which will monitor the amount of light the plants accumulate over the day. To save energy I will only switch on the lights as long as necessary if ambient light (sunlight) is available.
You can find an [example sketch and the library here](https://github.com/markbeee/BH1750FVI). The light sensor on a breakout board is available on Ebay, Aliexpress etc.

BH1750FVI connected to a ESP12 breadboard adapter board
(see my project [ESP8266 breadboard adapter board](https://github.com/markbeee/ESP8266_Breakout_Board))
